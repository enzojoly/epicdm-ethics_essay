%What can YOU suggest as KEY actions to take to ensure that this project is successful?


\section{Relevant Codes of Practice}

Professional codes of conduct provide software engineers with an ethical starting point for a deployment of this nature.
Given the bandwidth of this topic, and the scope of this report, exhaustive coverage of the full documentation is impossible, so key characteristics of differing guidelines will be the primary focal point.
The BCS focusses on professionals; the IEEE standardises the technological aspects; the ACM is more concerned with societal impact.

\subsection{BCS Code of Conduct}
%The British Computer Society addresses public interest, professional integrity and professional duty.

BCS members must demonstrate "due regard for public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of others and the environment" \textit{\parencite[p. 2]{BCS2024}}, particularly salient considering Alice will be handling sensitive student data and potentially influencing student wellbeing.

The BCS also mandates professionals to only provide service "within [their] professional competence" \textit{\parencite[p. 2]{BCS2024}} which begs the question: where exists the limit of Alice's 'competence' in the context of student support? Is a system's competency assumed to be an extension of the professionals who calibrated it?

Members are additionally required to "uphold the reputation of the profession" \textit{\parencite[p. 3]{BCS2024}}. This translates to full transparency regarding Alice's management and capabilities. Safeguards must also be in place to prevent misuse in order to preserve public trust of AI systems in education, let alone the trust of students.

\subsection{IEEE Code of Ethics}

%The IEEE Code of Ethics are particularly relevant to technological aspects of Alice.

Data retention and deletion policies must be established and clear, ensuring a commitment to "protection of... personal information and data" \textit{\parencite[p. 1]{IEEE2024}}, and a commitment to student privacy.
Engineers must identify and eliminate potential bias from the model and algorithms in use, such that Alice "not discriminate against any person because of characteristics protected by law" \textit{\parencite[p. 1]{IEEE2024}}.
This should be verified and assured with rigorous testing and regular audits, ensuring commitment to "honest and realistic... claims or estimates based on available data" \textit{\parencite[p. 2]{IEEE2024}}, coupled with an established mechanism for human oversight and intervention when Alice's confidence in a response is low.

\subsection{ACM Code of Ethics}

The ACM Code proposes that "all people are stakeholders in computing" \textit{\parencite[p. 1]{ACM2024}}, alluding that the enhancement of student wellbeing and academic success is not merely a nice gesture, but necessary for the betterment of society, assuming compliant (and considerate) execution.

    %\item Regularly assessing the broader impact of Alice on the educational ecosystem.
    %\item Designing features that promote digital literacy and responsible AI interaction among students.

%\subsubsection*{Avoid Harm}
%The ACM emphasises that computing professionals should "avoid harm to others" \textit{\parencite[p. 1]{ACM2024}}. In the context of 'Alice', this principle demands:

%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Implementing robust safeguards against potential psychological harm from AI interactions.
%    \item Establishing clear escalation protocols for situations where Alice detects potential self-harm or other serious issues.
%    \item Regular risk assessments to identify and mitigate potential negative consequences of the chatbot's use.
%\end{itemize}

Alice should be constructed with accessibility in mind, "[fostering] fair participation of all people, including those of underrepresented groups" \textit{\parencite[p. 2]{ACM2024}}.

%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Designing Alice's interface and interactions to be accessible to students with disabilities.
%    \item Ensuring that the chatbot's language models and knowledge base represent diverse perspectives and experiences.
%    \item Implementing features that promote equal access to educational resources and opportunities through Alice's recommendations.
%\end{itemize}


%\subsubsection*{Duty to Relevant Authority}

%\begin{itemize}
%    \item We must balance South Star Academy's requirements with ethical considerations and legal obligations.
%    \item Clear protocols must be established for situations where Alice's judgements might conflict with school policies.
%    \item Regular audits should be conducted to ensure Alice's actions align with both the school's requirements and broader ethical standards.
%\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Caveats to Information Processing}

Blundell argues that "such codes are seldom consulted and often incorporate bland (and sometimes contradictory) statements intended to satisfy a broad range of stakeholders" \textit{\parencite[p. 40]{Blundell2020}} and professionals must practise discernment and maintain awareness for the consequences of poor decision-making, both quantitatively and in qualitative aspects.
Underpinning deontological ethics is the notion that the professional is duty-bound to rely on their better judgement where universally established rules fail.
This remains one of Kant's core philosophical tenets, to "respect the reason in you".

BCS specifies duty to "due... diligence in accordance with the Relevant Authority's requirements whilst exercising... professional judgement at all times" \textit{\parencite[p. 2]{BCS2024}}. In our context: information relating to the endangerment of any student(s) would likely take precedent over privacy, as is established protocol \textit{In Loco Parentis}.
This should be at the discretion of human moderators by way of a sophisticated content-flagging system and anonymity secured by multiple key-holders to ensure consensus for de-anonymisation.
Students may be more comfortable anonymously, so this process of de-anonymising must be abuse-proof to ensure trust remains strong.
All decision-making processes must prioritise students foremost, with the necessary privacy precautions in place to protect student data alongside regular monitoring of the chatbot's holistic impact on the educational environment.
