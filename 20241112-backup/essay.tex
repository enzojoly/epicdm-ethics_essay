\section{Overview}
South Star Academy's proposed student support services chatbot `Alice' shows great promise in terms of market return, but scrutinous rigour and a diligent attention to detail will be necessary before such a system can be deemed production-ready. Ethical considerations need to be made concerning data privacy, accessibility, and user experience, as well as strict adherence to legal and professional standards, security best practices taken into account, and an overarching monitoring and management implementation strategy. This report comprises a comprehensive analysis and its resulting recommendations for deployment, such that TechSoft be fully cognisant of the key contemporary issues faced by an AI chatbot in education, and by extension the actions required for ethical practice, full legal compliance, and more.

\section{Relevant Professional Codes of Conduct}

The following elements from the BCS, IEEE, and ACM codes of conduct provide us with a rough guideline to start.

\subsection{BCS Code of Conduct}

The BCS Code of Conduct \textit{\parencite[p. 1]{BCS2024}} outlines four primary areas of professional responsibility, each of which has direct implications for the 'Alice' project:

\subsubsection*{Public Interest}
BCS members must have "due regard for public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of others and the environment" \textit{\parencite[p. 2]{BCS2024}}. This principle is particularly salient for 'Alice', as the chatbot will be handling sensitive student data and potentially influencing student wellbeing. We must ensure that:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Alice's decision-making processes prioritise student safety and wellbeing above all else.
    \item Robust privacy measures are implemented to protect student data from unauthorised access or breaches.
    \item The chatbot's impact on the educational environment is constantly monitored and evaluated.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Professional Competence and Integrity}
The BCS mandates that members should "only undertake to do work or provide a service that is within your professional competence" \textit{\parencite[p. 2]{BCS2024}}. This raises important questions about the competence boundaries of AI systems:

\begin{itemize}
    \item What will we define as outside the limit of Alice's 'competence' in student support?
    \item What mechanisms will be in place to ensure Alice does not overstep these boundaries?
    \item How will we ensure ongoing development of Alice's capabilities while maintaining integrity?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Duty to the Profession}
The BCS Code requires members to "accept your personal duty to uphold the reputation of the profession and not take any action which could bring the profession into disrepute" \textit{\parencite[p. 3]{BCS2024}}. For the 'Alice' project, this means:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Ensuring transparency about Alice's AI nature and capabilities to all users.
    \item Implementing robust safeguards against potential misuse or malfunction that could damage public trust in AI systems in education.
    \item Actively contributing to the development of best practices for AI in educational settings.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{IEEE Code of Ethics}

The IEEE Code of Ethics \textit{\parencite[p. 1]{IEEE2024}} provides additional ethical considerations that are particularly relevant to the technological aspects of 'Alice':

\subsubsection*{Respect for Privacy}
IEEE members commit to be "respectful of the privacy of others and the protection of their personal information and data" \textit{\parencite[p. 1]{IEEE2024}}. For 'Alice', this translates to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implementing state-of-the-art data protection measures.
    \item Designing Alice with privacy-by-default principles.
    \item Establishing clear data retention and deletion policies.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Fairness and Non-Discrimination}
The IEEE Code states that members "will not discriminate against any person because of characteristics protected by law" \textit{\parencite[p. 1]{IEEE2024}}. This principle is crucial for Alice's design:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Rigorous testing must be conducted to identify and eliminate potential biases in Alice's algorithms.
    \item The chatbot's language and responses must be inclusive and respectful of all student demographics.
    \item Regular audits should be performed to ensure equitable treatment of all users.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Honesty and Trustworthiness}
IEEE members commit to "be honest and realistic in stating claims or estimates based on available data" \textit{\parencite[p. 2]{IEEE2024}}. For the 'Alice' project, this means:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Clear communication of Alice's capabilities and limitations to all stakeholders.
    \item Implementing explainable AI techniques to provide transparency in decision-making processes.
    \item Establishing mechanisms for human oversight and intervention when Alice's confidence in a response is low.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ACM Code of Ethics}

The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct \textit{\parencite[p. 1]{ACM2023}} provides additional ethical principles that are particularly relevant to the societal impact of 'Alice':

\subsubsection*{Contribute to Society and Human Well-being}
The ACM Code states that computing professionals should "contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing" \textit{\parencite[p. 1]{ACM2023}}. For 'Alice', this principle translates to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Ensuring that the chatbot's primary goal is to enhance student well-being and academic success.
    \item Regularly assessing the broader impact of Alice on the educational ecosystem.
    \item Designing features that promote digital literacy and responsible AI interaction among students.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Avoid Harm}
The ACM emphasises that computing professionals should "avoid harm to others" \textit{\parencite[p. 1]{ACM2023}}. In the context of 'Alice', this principle demands:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implementing robust safeguards against potential psychological harm from AI interactions.
    \item Establishing clear escalation protocols for situations where Alice detects potential self-harm or other serious issues.
    \item Regular risk assessments to identify and mitigate potential negative consequences of the chatbot's use.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Ensure Fair Participation}
The ACM Code requires computing professionals to "foster fair participation of all people, including those of underrepresented groups" \textit{\parencite[p. 2]{ACM2023}}. For the 'Alice' project, this means:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Designing Alice's interface and interactions to be accessible to students with disabilities.
    \item Ensuring that the chatbot's language models and knowledge base represent diverse perspectives and experiences.
    \item Implementing features that promote equal access to educational resources and opportunities through Alice's recommendations.
\end{itemize}

By adhering to these specific elements of the BCS, IEEE, and ACM codes of conduct, we can ensure that the development and implementation of 'Alice' at South Star Academy not only meets professional standards but also sets a new benchmark for ethical AI deployment in educational settings. These guidelines will inform our technical decisions, shape our data governance policies, and guide our interactions with stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle.

\subsubsection*{Duty to Relevant Authority}
BCS members must "carry out professional responsibilities with due care and diligence in accordance with the Relevant Authority's requirements whilst exercising your professional judgement at all times" \textit{\parencite[p. 2]{BCS2024}}. In our context:

\begin{itemize}
    \item We must balance South Star Academy's requirements with ethical considerations and legal obligations.
    \item Clear protocols must be established for situations where Alice's judgments might conflict with school policies.
    \item Regular audits should be conducted to ensure Alice's actions align with both the school's requirements and broader ethical standards.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Caveats of a Deontological Outlook}

From an objective and cynical standpoint, however, "such codes are seldom consulted and often incorporate bland (and sometimes contradictory) statements intended to satisfy a broad range of stakeholders" \textit{\parencite[p. 40]{Blundell2020}} and professionals must practise discernment and maintain awareness for the consequences of poor decision-making, both quantitatively and in qualitative aspects. Underpinning all ethical consideration one might argue that it is a professional's role to go beyond the call of duty where suitable, not straying outside of Kantian philosophy in fact, for he was a stark proponent of logical reasoning, evident in his mantra, "respect the reason in you", where universally established rules fail.
